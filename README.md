**Building Scalable AWS Architecture with Terraform Automation**

Designed and automated a highly available and scalable AWS architecture using Terraform, incorporating VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, RDS databases, ALB, Route 53, and IAM security controls. Implemented modular Terraform configurations for efficient infrastructure management, ensuring security, scalability, and automation. Leveraged multi-AZ RDS for high availability, ALB for traffic distribution, and Route 53 for DNS routing, reducing manual effort and improving consistency. This project reinforced the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in streamlining cloud deployments and enhancing AWS resource management.
